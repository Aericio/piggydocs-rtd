Contact and Support
===================

If you still require additional help after consulting the documentation, you can join the `Piggy Hangouts`_ Discord server.

  * Upon joining the server, you will be greeted with a list of rules and information which you have 10 minutes to read.
  * Failure to comply with these rules will instantly lead to a ban; there are typically no warnings given.
  * Use ``g!roleslist`` and assign yourself the ``Minecraft`` role to access Minecraft-related channels.
  * Do not expect an instant reply, we don't have a 24/7 support team. An answer will usually be given within 24 hours.

If you require help with general PocketMine-MP plugins, go to the `PocketMine-MP Community`_ Discord server instead.
